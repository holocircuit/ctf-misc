# Little Language
(Misc, 250 points)

There's a text file describing a formal grammar for a language.
There's also a picture, which suggests we have to log in as username "root", with a password.

The password is hidden at the bottom of the PNG file.

We can then log in by using the grammar to define the variables "username" and "password", and then running the ":flag" command to get the flag.
