# Zippity
A server which asks you questions about longitude / latitude of zip codes.

Find data about them here - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/erichurst/7882666/raw/5bdc46db47d9515269ab12ed6fb2850377fd869e/US%2520Zip%2520Codes%2520from%25202013%2520Government%2520Data.

Then it's pretty quick to write some Python which parses this and answers the questions.
